            <h2 class="underline">Who are we?</h2>
            <p>We are a small business specializing in organic, locally grown foods. We are physically located in Carlsbad, California, however,
                We have many food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. We sell fruits and produce directly from the
                farmers in our area and some national and international suppliers. We are an owner-operated company that caters to walk-in traffic
                and, of course, their food trucks. We deliver and manage those orders on the phone and via our website. Our mission is to provide
                fresh and healthy food options, including organic, made to order, fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the local population and to
                tourists visiting our wonderful coastal areas.</p>
